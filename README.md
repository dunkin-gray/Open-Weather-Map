# Open-Weather-Map

UC Davis | Web Design Challenge

For this challenge, I reviewed data from a previous project on the relationship between a city's weather trends and its proximity to the equator. I first updated the data in Pandas and the graphs in Matplotlib with today's date. I then used HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap to design a github pages site to review the data in a more user-friendly format.

Click through the site here to review a deeper analysis of my findings: https://dunkin-gray.github.io/Open-Weather-Map/HTML/index.html

**HTML_Pages**
